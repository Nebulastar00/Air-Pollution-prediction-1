# Main_project

Predicting Air quality index using diffrent machine Learning models:
  1.Random forest
  2.Xtream Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
  3.CatBoost
  4.Deep Learning (Multilayer perceptron)
  
  
Detection of Air pollution: 
    is using Logistic Regression That can detect the air pollution and classify air pollution is high or not
 
 
Interface Using shiny:
  Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R.
  it is used for showing the insight of the data and prediction
